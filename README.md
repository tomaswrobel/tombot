## üöÄ Getting Started

First, clone the repo. Then, provide these environment variables:

Then build with TypeScript.

## üìù Features & Commands

- ‚ùì Quiz
	
`/quiz [custom?]` - Start a quiz. If `custom` is provided, you can specify the categories.

- Delete

`/delete [amount]` - Delete the last `amount` messages.

## Custom command

Creating custom command is as fast as creating a file.

Under the `commands` folder, create a TypeScript file with the same name as your command.

```ts
import SlashCommand from "../src/SlashCommand.js";

export default new SlashCommand(
	{
		description: "Your description",
	},
	// User is automatically typed
	async function* (user) {
		// When yoy yield, the reply is sent / edited
		yield `Hello world, @${user.tag}!`;

		// If you really need the Interaction API, you use this:
		yield `Hello world, @${this.user.tag}!`;
	},
	// You can specify as many options as you wish
	{
		type: "User",
		name: "user",
		required: true,
	}
);
```
